# Jupyter at Research Facilities

This is a list of resources for developing, deploying, and using Jupyter at
research facilities, including experimental/observational facilities and HPC
centers. Contributors include:

* Argonne National Lab
* Brookhaven National Lab
* Compute Canada
* European XFEL
* Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
* National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Berkeley Lab
    * Our deployment repo: https://github.com/NERSC/jupyterhub-deploy
    * https://github.com/NERSC/nerscspawner
        * NERSC currently has 2 production hubs and 1 test hub
        * This spawner is a prototype setup for future combined hub
        * For this to be ready for production, need named servers to work at least
        * This code is very much work in progress

There is a [jupyter-research-facilties Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter-research-facilities).
