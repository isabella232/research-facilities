# Jupyter at Research Facilities Working Group

Chairs: Hans Fangohr

## Meeting details

The Jupyter at Research Facilities working group will be meeting during the  
JupyterCon Community Sprint from 9:00am to 5:00pm on Saturday, August 25, at the Hilton Midtown (Murray Hill), sponsored by Bloomberg.

## Objectives

During this time, the Jupyter at Research working group which will include a wide range of research facilities (such as X-ray light sources, astronomical observatories, genetics centres, etc.). Along with Jupyter core developers, we'll be discussing the unique needs of research facilities when using Project Jupyter tools, such as:

1. Large data sets that are expensive to produce and prohibitive to transport need to be stored and analyzed for long periods of time. Often these data sets must be analyzed remotely.
2. Large computational resources (such as clusters or supercomputers) need to be scheduled and shared among facility users and accessed remotely.
3. Remote teams need to work in collaboration with facility personnel or on-site team members to collect and analyze data. This includes both interactive collaboration as the data is being collected and analysis long after the data has been collected.
4. Reproducible computational results, including narrative, data, code, and output, need to be stored and accessible remotely for potentially long periods of time.
5. Results need to be converted to formats suitable for publication and sharing with the broader community.
